Card Link Game

## Description

Have you ever play this game before? Multiple cards place on the table with back on. You need to match the cards with the same graphs in limited chances. I want to mimic this game. When players click one card, then image shows up. The two cards shared the same image which are selected by users will disappear. Then players will get points. In the whole game, the chances users can flip cards are limited.

## Areas of development

* Know well: How to count down time. How to select cards. How to get points. How to check if user selects the correct pairs
* How to shuffle the cards for a new game.
* If possible, I want to the process of fliping card is dynamic. So I want to add animation

## Challenges

How to randomly locate the cards. How to startup and make sure the cards' locations are not the same with the last match. If possible, I also want to create a rank list for all clients who played this game, which means I need a server. This is my advanced ambition.

## Ideal outcome

User can smoothly play this game. This game can be simple, but there should be no bug. The buttons are working as expected. Show up and disappear.
