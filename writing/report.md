# CMPSC 302 Final Report

Please respond to the following prompts.

## Was your project a success? Describe why or why not.

Generally speaking, I feel it's a success. This game worked as expected. I even have more features I didn't expect to have at first, which is very cool. So the set up was working. The cards successfully math the positions and the images were drawn in the correct positions within the appropriate sizes. Then when the game begins, the count down and chance messages work as expected to track the process of this game. You can lose this game in two ways: time out and chance out. If you lose, the lose message will prompt out. You can succeed by matching all the cards in the limited chances and limited time. Also, the cards are successfully chosen, show up and compare if there is another card showing up. This process is achieved successfully. Then if these two cards share no the same images then the cards will flip back, otherwise they will show up all the time to say you've already got those two pairs correctly. 

## What surprising skills did you learn as part of developing the project?

I learned a lot about Javascript and its specific syntax. I was not familiar with the Javascript before. It's so different from Python and another thing is that you should visualize the codes on the website. This project, therefore, is extremely challenging to me. Because Javascript has few library and powerful default classes, the methods it has and the values its methods return look weird to at first. Also, because Javascript is implemented to assist with html, the content of html should be put in mind. It's surprising that I overcame those problems and developed a playable games.

## Reflect on the areas where you believe you've demonstrated the most strength/knowledge.

Reflect on the codes, I believe my strength and knowledge can expose in the setting up of this game. In the game, 5 cards in the docs will be randomly targeted. The buttons will be mapped with those cards. The images will show up on the buttons. The problem is that within those 5 cards, 4 of them will show up twice and the last one will only show up once, which means cards assigned in the same list will be treated differently. First of all, I tried to differentiate them by  creating different conditions and doing different behaviors. Then the fact Prof. Luman pointed proved that this method is too complex and dangerous because the bugs are hard to track under this condition. I learned a lot from creating those features and polishing them into a better versions under superior algorithms.
