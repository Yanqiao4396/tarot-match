# CMPSC 302 Project Update

Please provide responses to the following questions.

## Describe the progress you've made toward completing your project.

From now on, the index file is already. There are three parts. The instruction, the cards and the prompted result. Instruction tells player how to play this game and what's the victory and defeated conditions. The cards are contained in a grid and work as buttons. One of noteworthy features is that there is no image tag in the html. The image will be added by Javascript. The result has two versions: victory and lose. These two divs are set as hidden as default. One of them will prompt out when condition is met.
The Javascript just get started. Right now the projects has the ability to have button.

## What areas are still challenging? What are some unforeseen issues that have arisen?

One of biggest problems I am struggling to is the match. To set up this game, I need to randomly target 5 pictures, match them with the buttons and then create the correct pictures in the correct button. 

## Detail one success that you've achieved.

I feel I did a good job on the index html. This layout is reasonable. The grid did make the game look better. Also, I am proud of myself adding the hidden disabled button in the appropriate places to construct multiple layers of pages. Also, the image can be added correctly above the buttons as a child of it. So that I have ability to put the images and buttons in just one div, which will simplify my work on Javascript.

## In what, if any, areas would you like additional assistance?

I feel I am all good now. However, the set up may lead to some problems in the future. I do have this intuition.
